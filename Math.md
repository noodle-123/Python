Polynomial Graphing on a line and inequalities
If odd, pass through number line, if even, skip
proceed to solve after, find designated areas
Ex:
(x+2)(x-1)>0
Graph line using roots -2 and 1

## 2. solve 2/(x-1)<=3

x-1=!0  
__Case 1:__
x-1>0:
Do not change sign and multiply.
x>1
2<=3x-3
5<=3x
5/3<=x,
x>=5/3.

__Case 2:__
x-1<0:
Change sign (reverse signs)
2>3(x-1)
2>3x-3
5>3x
x<5/3,
compare with x<1.
x<1 is less, so answer is x<1 for Case 2.

Final answer:
x>=5/3 or x<1.

## 3.Solve: |x+1|+|3x-2|=2.

----------------------
Solution:
3 cases on the number line.
Plot the roots of the inside of each absolute value brackets on the number line.
There should be 3 segments.

For Segment 1,
Take a test point that is < -1 and plug in the equations (x+1 and 3x-2).
If it is negative, we write the whole equation inside the absolute brackets negatively.
We should get -x-1-3x+2=2.
Solve, and we get -1/4. 
However, -1/4 is not inside the range of less than -1. Therefore, this solution is not valid.

For Segment 2,
We do the same thing, giving us x+1-3x+2=2 and x=1/2. This is inside the range, so we keep it.
